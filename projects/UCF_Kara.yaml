Description: "We are investigating the utility of sophisticated computational methods\
  \ for material design and discovery \u2014 this includes but is not limited to density\
  \ functional theory, genetic algorithms, and machine learning. Our applications\
  \ include catalysis, energy storage, and device design. At the moment, we are focusing\
  \ on high entropy materials, and analyzing the extent to which these methods can\
  \ help us screen the vast possibilities available to such systems."
