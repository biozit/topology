Description: >-
  Our research focuses on understanding the dynamics of mitonuclear
  co-evolution in populations of microorganisms. We use experimental
  evolution, next-generation sequencing, and systems biology
  approaches to study how populations adapt to different pairs of
  nuclear and mitochondrial genomes to uncover the mechanisms
  underlying these processes.
