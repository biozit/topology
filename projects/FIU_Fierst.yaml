Department: Biological Sciences
Description: Research in the Fierst lab focuses around computational approaches to
  studying evolution of the genome in different organisms. We study how life is organized,
  structured, and changes and how we can use theory, computational models and bioinformatic
  analyses to understand it. https://case.fiu.edu/about/directory/profiles/fierst-janna.html;
