Description: "This project is for an XSEDE/Access Champions allocation, so there is no project that is planned for OSG presently. TDAI serves over 200 faculty affiliates that have interest in various aspects of Data Science, with researchers spanning disciplines from foundational methods, to applications in a variety of sciences, to data governance and policy. The intention of obtaining an OSG project is similar to other Champions accounts: to have resources readily available for researchers to test-drive against their workflow prior to obtaining their own allocations. https://tdai.osu.edu/research-action"
